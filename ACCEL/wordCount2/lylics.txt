Are you, are you
Coming to the tree?
They strung up a man
They say who murdered three
Strange things did happen here, no stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree
Are you, are you
Coming to the tree?
Where dead man called out
For his love to flee
Strange things did happen here, no stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree
Are you, are you
Coming to the tree?
Where I told you to run
So we'd both be free
Strange things did happen here, no stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree
Are you, are you
Coming to the tree?
Wear a necklace of hope
Side by side with me
Strange things did happen here, no stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree
Are you, are you
Coming to the tree?
Where I told you to run
So we'd both be free
Strange things did happen here, no stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree
Are you, are you
Coming to the tree?
They strung up a man
They say who murdered three
Strange things did happen here, no stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree
Are you, are you
Coming to the tree?
Where dead man called out for his love to flee
Strange things did happen here, no stranger would it be
If we met at midnight in the hanging tree
